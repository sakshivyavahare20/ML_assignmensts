# Machine Learning Assignments - Sakshi Vyavahare

Welcome to my repository for machine learning assignments completed as part of my coursework. This repo contains theory explanations, code implementations, and datasets used for various ML tasks, organized across multiple assignments.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each assignment has its own dedicated folder named:

- `Assignment01`  
- `Assignment02`  
- `Assignment03`  
- `Assignment04`  
- `Assignment06`  
- `Assignment07`  

Inside each folder, you will find:

- ✅ **Soft copy (theory PDF or .txt)**  
- ✅ **Main code file (.ipynb)**  
- ✅ **Required dataset (.csv or .xlsx)**  

## 💡 Important Note

Initially, I uploaded only code files . Later, I organized everything into the respective folders mentioned above.  
However, you will find all **code or files in the root directory** (outside the folders). These are the same files, just not organized at first.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Across these 7 assignments, I have explored and implemented:

- Data preprocessing
- Classification models (e.g., Decision Tree)
- Regression
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, tree plots)
- Model training & testing using scikit-learn

## 📚 Libraries Used

- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
